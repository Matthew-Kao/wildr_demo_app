- I don't know how to test the camera on IOS. From my web search, they told me to test it using a real device. 
Will try to test in on a real (never done it before)
- Figure out a way to show the status bar in both pages, not only on one page

March 14
- Should the app allow the user to click images while the compression is going on? The problem is that the compression messages would overlap

March 15
- Problem with the camera tab, the IOS emulator would not allow me to access cameras, it would only work on android

March 16 
- The app would allow user to select images while the compression is going on. However, since Flutter does not allow stacked SnackBars,
I would have to show the compression messages one by one without overlapping, i.e use a queue, show one message, when it is done, show the other

- How should we display a video in the photos tab? Should we allow the user to preview the video? I believe the answer should be yes.
Then the problem becomes how? How should the user be able to preview the video if a single tap of the video means compressing the video? 
I will try to add a double tap functionality for videos in order allow the user to preview the video

March 18
- can the same image or picture be selected?

March 19
- Still having a problem with allowing the user to take a video, how do we show a frame of the video in the status bar?

March 20
- The user can now record a video. However, I need to figure out a way to allow the user to differentiate whether they have selected an image
or video, they currently look the same.

March 21
- Should we distinguish in the status bar, whether a user have selected an image or video?

March 22
- Having problems with allowing a video icon to show up in the status bar, to indicate a video is selected instead of an image

March 23
- Finally found a solution to how we could make a video in the status load with a video icon in the middle

March 24
- Finished all the functionality, next up: Make the UI prettier

March 25
- Finished matching color schemes

March 26
